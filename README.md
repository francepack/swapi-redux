# Swapi-Redux
Find information about Star Wars characters, vehicles, and planets using Swapi-Box!

## Technologies and learning Goals
This project uses react-redux and react-router.

This project was made for Turing School. We had made a similar project using just react and were challenged to revisit it to practice implementing redux and router.
